# README: Urban Food Delivery Orders Analysis

## Project Overview
This repository contains a study exploring the impact of two key variables - distance to the nearest restaurant and car availability - on the frequency of food delivery orders among urban dwellers. The dataset and analysis in this project are simulated for research purposes.

## Dataset Description
- **Source**: Simulated using probability distribution functions in R.
- **Variables**: Distance to nearest restaurant, car availability, frequency of food delivery orders.
- **Observations**: 344.

## Research Question
The study aims to understand if and how the distance to the nearest restaurant and the availability of a car influence urban dwellers' frequency of ordering food delivery.

## Analysis Methodology
- **Statistical Model**: Poisson Regression.
- **Objective**: To quantify the variance in the frequency of food delivery orders explained by the distance to the closest restaurant and car availability.

## Goals of the Analysis
1. Determine the relationship between the distance to the nearest restaurant and the frequency of food delivery orders.
2. Assess the impact of having access to a car on the frequency of ordering food delivery.
3. Quantify the combined effect of these variables on urban food delivery habits.

## How to Use This Repository
- The dataset and the R script for the Poisson regression analysis are available in the repository.
- Users can replicate the analysis or modify the R script to explore further.

## Note
This is a simulated study designed for analytical practice and demonstration purposes. The dataset and results should not be interpreted as real-world findings.
